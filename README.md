# Jira Projects Lab  
### *Hands-on training environment for mastering Jira Service Management*

---

## 📌 Overview  
This repository contains my personal Jira training lab (using Jira Cloud Free Plan), created to build real-world experience with Jira Service Management, ticket lifecycle design, and customer support workflows.  
The purpose is to demonstrate practical skills relevant to Customer Support, Customer Success, IT Support, and Technical Support roles.

---

## 🎯 Purpose  
I built these labs to:

- Learn how to configure Jira Service Management from scratch  
- Understand the full customer-to-agent workflow  
- Practice workflow design, automation logic, SLAs, and queue management  
- Strengthen operational troubleshooting skills  
- Document everything clearly for hiring managers

---

## 🛠️ Support Service Desk  
A full support environment mirroring how real teams operate.

### Key Features  
- Customer portal enabled  
- Email intake enabled  
- Simplified and intuitive workflows  
- Structured hardware/software request forms  
- SLA foundations  
- Clean queues for real triage

### Automation Implemented  
- **Auto-close after X days of inactivity**  
- **Auto-set ticket to Pending when customer replies**  
- **Auto-set ticket to In Progress when agent comments**  
These are standard in real support operations to maintain speed and prevent ticket stagnation.

## 💬 Final Note  
This lab demonstrates that I can not only use Jira as an agent —

It showcases practical operational understanding, technical configuration skills, and the ability to document everything clearly for professional audiences.
